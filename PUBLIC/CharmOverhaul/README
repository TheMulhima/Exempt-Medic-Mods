My personal attempt to port the Charm Overhaul mod to 1.5. Created following the information found at this steam discussion post: https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/1732089092462513717/
Does not implement Avaricious Swarm, Sorcerer Stone, the damage-dealing part of Kinematic Shell, or any of the "Not yet implemented" section except for the Flukenest damage and cost increase.

Known Issues:
Hiveshell does not visually update the Baldur Shell HUD icon, though it updates under the hood.
Gilded Hunger + Homeward Swarm can cause the SOUL meter to display incorrectly after casting a Spell that kills an enemy.
